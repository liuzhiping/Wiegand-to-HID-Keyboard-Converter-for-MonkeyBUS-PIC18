	//On PIC18 devices, addresses 0x00, 0x08, and 0x18 are used for
	//the reset, high priority interrupt, and low priority interrupt
	//vectors.  However, the current Microchip USB bootloader 
	//examples are intended to occupy addresses 0x00-0x7FF or
	//0x00-0xFFF depending on which bootloader is used.  Therefore,
	//the bootloader code remaps these vectors to new locations
	//as indicated below.  This remapping is only necessary if you
	//wish to program the hex file generated from this project with
	//the USB bootloader.  If no bootloader is used, edit the

	//been defined, but then the output hex file is not programmed with
	//the bootloader, addresses 0x08 and 0x18 would end up programmed with 0xFFFF.
	//As a result, if an actual interrupt was enabled and occured, the PC would jump
	//to 0x08 (or 0x18) and would begin executing "0xFFFF" (unprogrammed space).  This
	//executes as nop instructions, but the PC would eventually reach the REMAPPED_RESET_VECTOR_ADDRESS
	//(0x1000 or 0x800, depending upon bootloader), and would execute the "goto _startup".  This
	//would effective reset the application.
	
	//To fix this situation, we should always deliberately place a 
	//"goto REMAPPED_HIGH_INTERRUPT_VECTOR_ADDRESS" at address 0x08, and a
	//"goto REMAPPED_LOW_INTERRUPT_VECTOR_ADDRESS" at address 0x18.  When the output
	//hex file of this project is programmed with the bootloader, these sections do not
	//get bootloaded (as they overlap the bootloader space).  If the output hex file is not

//	The USB specifications require that USB peripheral devices must never source

//	current on D+ or D- when the host/hub is not actively powering the Vbus line.
//	When designing a self powered (as opposed to bus powered) USB peripheral
//	device, the firmware should make sure not to turn on the USB module and D+
//	or D- pull up resistor unless Vbus is actively powered.  Therefore, the
//	firmware needs some means to detect when Vbus is being powered by the host.
//	A 5V tolerant I/O pin can be connected to Vbus (through a resistor), and
// 	can be used to detect when Vbus is high (host actively powering), or low
//	(host is shut down or otherwise not supplying power).  The USB firmware
// 	can then periodically poll this I/O pin to know when it is okay to turn on
//	the USB module/D+/D- pull up resistor.  When designing a purely bus powered
//	peripheral device, it is not possible to source current on D+ or D- when the
//	host is not actively providing power on Vbus. Therefore, implementing this
//	bus sense feature is optional.  This firmware can be made to use this bus
//	sense feature by making sure "USE_USB_BUS_SENSE_IO" has been defined in the
//	HardwareProfile.h file.

//	self and bus powered, it should not return a hard coded value for this request.
//	Instead, firmware should check if it is currently self or bus powered, and
//	respond accordingly.  If the hardware has been configured like demonstrated
//	on the PICDEM FS USB Demo Board, an I/O pin can be polled to determine the
//	currently selected power source.  On the PICDEM FS USB Demo Board, "RA2"

// ************** USB Callback Functions ****************************************************************
// ******************************************************************************************************
// The USB firmware stack will call the callback functions USBCBxxx() in response to certain USB related
// events.  For example, if the host PC is powering down, it will stop sending out Start of Frame (SOF)
// packets to your device.  In response to this, all USB devices are supposed to decrease their power
// consumption from the USB Vbus to <2.5mA each.  The USB module detects this condition (which according
// to the USB specifications is 3+ms of no bus activity/SOF packets) and then calls the USBCBSuspend()
// function.  You should modify these callback functions to take appropriate actions for each of these
// conditions.  For example, in the USBCBSuspend(), you may wish to add code that will decrease power
// consumption from Vbus to <2.5mA (such as by clock switching, turning off LEDs, putting the
// microcontroller to sleep, etc.).  Then, in the USBCBWakeFromSuspend() function, you may then wish to
// add code that undoes the power saving things done in the USBCBSuspend() function.

// The USBCBSendResume() function is special, in that the USB stack will not automatically call this
// function.  This function is meant to be called from the application firmware instead.  See the
// additional comments near the function.

// Note *: The "usb_20.pdf" specs indicate 500uA or 2.5mA, depending upon device classification. However,
// the USB-IF has officially issued an ECN (engineering change notice) changing this to 2.5mA for all 
// devices.  Make sure to re-download the latest specifications to get all of the newest ECNs.

 * Overview:        The USB specifications allow some types of USB
 * 					peripheral devices to wake up a host PC (such
 *					as if it is in a low power suspend to RAM state).
 *					This can be a very useful feature in some
 *					USB applications, such as an Infrared remote
 *					control	receiver.  If a user presses the "power"
 *					button on a remote control, it is nice that the
 *					IR receiver can detect this signalling, and then
 *					send a USB "command" to the PC to wake up.
 *					
 *					The USBCBSendResume() "callback" function is used
 *					to send this special USB signalling which wakes 
 *					up the PC.  This function may be called by
 *					application firmware to wake up the PC.  This
 *					function will only be able to wake up the host if
 *                  all of the below are true:
 *					
 *					1.  The USB driver used on the host PC supports
 *						the remote wakeup capability.
 *					2.  The USB configuration descriptor indicates
 *						the device is remote wakeup capable in the
 *						bmAttributes field.
 *					3.  The USB host PC is currently sleeping,
 *						and has previously sent your device a SET 
 *						FEATURE setup packet which "armed" the
 *						remote wakeup capability.   
 *
 *                  If the host has not armed the device to perform remote wakeup,
 *                  then this function will return without actually performing a
 *                  remote wakeup sequence.  This is the required behavior, 
 *                  as a USB device that has not been armed to perform remote 
 *                  wakeup must not drive remote wakeup signalling onto the bus;
 *                  doing so will cause USB compliance testing failure.
 *                  
 *					This callback should send a RESUME signal that
 *                  has the period of 1-15ms.
 *
 * Note:            This function does nothing and returns quickly, if the USB
 *                  bus and host are not in a suspended condition, or are 
 *                  otherwise not in a remote wakeup ready state.  Therefore, it
 *                  is safe to optionally call this function regularly, ex: 
 *                  anytime application stimulus occurs, as the function will
 *                  have no effect, until the bus really is in a state ready
 *                  to accept remote wakeup. 
 *
 *                  When this function executes, it may perform clock switching,
 *                  depending upon the application specific code in 
 *                  USBCBWakeFromSuspend().  This is needed, since the USB
 *                  bus will no longer be suspended by the time this function
 *                  returns.  Therefore, the USB module will need to be ready
 *                  to receive traffic from the host.
 *
 *                  The modifiable section in this routine may be changed
 *                  to meet the application needs. Current implementation
 *                  temporary blocks other functions from executing for a
 *                  period of ~3-15 ms depending on the core frequency.
 *
 *                  According to USB 2.0 specification section 7.1.7.7,
 *                  "The remote wakeup device must hold the resume signaling
 *                  for at least 1 ms but for no more than 15 ms."
 *                  The idea here is to use a delay counter loop, using a
 *                  common value that would work over a wide range of core
 *                  frequencies.
 *                  That value selected is 1800. See table below:
 *                  ==========================================================
 *                  Core Freq(MHz)      MIP         RESUME Signal Period (ms)
 *                  ==========================================================
 *                      48              12          1.05
 *                       4              1           12.6
 *                  ==========================================================
 *                  * These timing could be incorrect when using code
 *                    optimization or extended instruction mode,
 *                    or when having other interrupts enabled.
 *                    Make sure to verify using the MPLAB SIM's Stopwatch
 *                    and verify the actual signal on an oscilloscope.
